# Portfolio_website
Hello,
This is Sahil Chauhan, I made this portfolio website using HTML & CSS to design the website colour schemes and looks.
I have linked my varios social accounts to the website as well as i have linked  the certificates to the Institue's original certification data.
I have deployed this website using the free service provided by
www.netlify.com (huge thanks for setting up my website).
Thank You,
Happy Coding!
