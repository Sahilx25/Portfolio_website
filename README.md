# Portfolio Website
Hello,<br>
This is Sahil Chauhan, I made this portfolio website using HTML & CSS.
I have linked my varios social accounts to the website as well as i have linked  the certificates to the Institue's original certification data.
I have deployed this website using the free service provided by
www.netlify.com.<br><br>
You can visit my website by clicking on the following link :<br>

(Use Computer/Laptop to open the website CSS code not optimized to open the website in mobile phones and other devices.)<br><br>
Thank You,<br>
Happy Coding!<br><br>
