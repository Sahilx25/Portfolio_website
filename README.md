# Portfolio Website
Hello,<br>
This is Sahil Chauhan, I made this portfolio website using HTML & CSS.
I have linked my GitHub and LinkedIn accounnt to the website and my Resume in pdf format.
I have also linked my certifications (Along with Institutions's original certification data).
I have deployed this website using the free service provided by www.netlify.com .<br><br>
You can visit my website by clicking on the following link :<br>
