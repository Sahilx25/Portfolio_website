# Portfolio Website
Hello,<br>
This is Sahil Chauhan, I made this portfolio website using HTML & CSS.
I have linked my GitHub, LinkedIn and gmail to the website and my CV is also attached in the website.
I have also linked my certifications (Along with Institutions's original certification data).
I have deployed this website using GitHub Pages.<br><br>
You can visit my website by clicking on the following link :<br>
